    You are tasked with writing a program that identifies the name of a month based on the input provided by the user. The user will enter a number between 1 and 12, where each number corresponds to a month of the year.
Input Range:
If the user inputs a number between 1 and 8, your program should print the corresponding month name (January to August).
For numbers greater than 8, the program should execute the default case, outputting a message like "Invalid input or Month beyond August."
